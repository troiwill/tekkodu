=======================================

## The Essence of the Project
Microsoft's [Kodu Game Lab](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/) is a programming environment designed for young children. Kodu programmers create computer games by writing behavioral rules for animated characters. This research develops strategies for mapping Kodu's idealized perception and manipulation primitives onto real robots, which have significant physical constraints. Out target platform is the [Calliope2SP](http://www.roprodesign.com/educational-robots/calliope/) robot.

## Problem with Implementing Kodu's Primitives on a Real Robot
In Kodu's virtual environment, perception and manipulation are instantaneous, omnidirectional, and never fail. On a real robot, vision is slow, expensive, and limited to where the camera is pointed. Also, a robot can only manipulate an object within the gripper's reach, and because gripping is unreliable, the gripper may lose the object while the robot is moving. For these reasons we need strategies to reliably implement Kodu's primitives on a real robot such as the Calliope2SP.
